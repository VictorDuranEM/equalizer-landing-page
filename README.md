## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site: <https://equalizer-landing-page-beta.vercel.app//>
- Source Code: <https://github.com/VictorDuranEM/equalizer-landing-page>

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm getting better and faster at using Tailwind CSS. I've also been able to experiment quite a bit with translations and backgrounds.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to explore the posibilities of doing the same things I did with translations and backgrounds maybe in a different way.
